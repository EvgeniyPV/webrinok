    <td>The name of the host server that the database resides on.  
        Many times this will be 'localhost', however each hosting provider will have its own naming
        convention so please check with your server administrator or host to determine the proper host name.  
        To add a port number, just append it to the host i.e. 'localhost:3306'.</td>
