    <h3>Installer Modes</h3>
    The installer has two operating modes: 
    <ol>
        <li>
            <b>Basic:</b>  This is a simple two step mode with all options set to the defaults.
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Advanced:</b> This four step mode allows for very custom details settings.
        </li>
    </ol>    
    This help is geared toward the four step Advanced mode but the information still 
    applies to the two step Basic since it is a subset of Advanced.
