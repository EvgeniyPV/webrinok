    <td>
        Indicates the table will be imported into the database.   This includes the creation of the table and all its data.  Turn off this switch to prevent
        the table from being added to the database.  This option is on by default for all tables.  If excluding a table be sure you know the underlying
        impact of not including it, if you are not sure then it is recommended to keep this value on.
