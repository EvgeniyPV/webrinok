    <td class="col-opt">Host</td>
    <td>This should be the primary domain account URL that is associated with your host. 
        Most hosts will require you to register a primary domain name.
        This should be the URL that you place in the host field. 
        For example if your primary domain name is "mysite.com" then you would enter in
        "https://mysite.com:2083".  The port 2038 is the common port number that cPanel works on. 
        If you do not know your primary domain name please contact your
        hosting provider or server administrator.
